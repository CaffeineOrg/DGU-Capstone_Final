In this video, I will show you how to use kernels with this p.m. To Performance model in your classes occasion. As we know them create a lion or a plane to separate data points into classes. The fact that the boundary between classes is Flac is a pro because it makes SVG. I'm easier to work with but is also an invitation because most digits is in the real world cannot be separated by hyperplane a workaround to this limitation, is to First Supply in a linear transformation to the data points before. F1 s p.m. With this technique, we can easily achieve the desired effect of getting analyst in your decision. Laundry, without changing her ways, Beyond Moritz internally. This is extremely easy to do in Python. For example, we load out training data points and label as usual. But now, when we call SVG ms.fit function, we don't do sex. But rather f of x equals x is analyst near transformation effects. From a shin might look something like this. SVG M will return a flat type of planes. Hit pricing, that you classes, as usual bits in the original expace. This corresponds to analyst near the sigma training mission accomplished. Should we stop here and call it today? Well, not quite the first problem is that we need to choose what this neural energy transformation should be but as everybody knows, she has are lazy people. So the fewer choices we have to make the happier. We are the second problem is that if we want a sophisticated decision, boundary, we need to increase the dimension of the output of this transformation. And this in turn increases Camp rotational requirements. The so-called kernel trick with invented to solve both of these problems in one shot. Each point is map to enter this node in your transformation. The only thing that you need to know is how each point compared to each other. They term point after we applied analytics transformation mathematically, this corresponds with, thinking The Interpreter SVG whenever affect sand Fox5 and we called the quantity, the kernel function.  For example, the identity transformation corresponds to the linearregression or given by X Ram suppose X by the linear kernel, give a Flac decision boundary, which in this case is not good enough to separate the data properly. A full node transformation. Like this one responds to the polynomial, kernel know that expression of the kernel function is simple and easy to compute. Even though the transformation itself is complicated and do a poisson normal kernel takes into account. The original features of a dataset just like, linearregression or multiple that. It also considers their interaction. It takes a single line of code to use this phone normal kernel with this unexpected. This gives a curved decision boundary. Sometimes it is possible to give a kernel function for which it is hard or even impossible to find the corresponding transformation. A prime example of this is the popular radial basis function. Kernel node is the corresponding Eleanor transformation complicated. It is actually infinite dimensional. So it is impossible to use directly in a computer program, but the kernel expression is incredibly simple.  And a gun with a single line of code, you can experiment with this kernel and you can play with this Prime with your grandma to make the boundary smooth or rough. Since I'm already the kernel trick is so incredibly powerful that it feels like using the cheat code in a video game. Multi is much easier to tweak and get creative with kernels, but we don't have to worry about the dimension of the output anymore. Thank you very much for watching and see you next time.
